    <p>
        Get her name and get her number<br>
Find out all of the things<br>
that we have in common<br>
Never all the differences,<br>
oh, yeah<br>
Meet her parents, meet her brother<br>
Then she starts sleepin'<br>
over the crib on weekends<br>
Like a real relationship, oh, no<br>
For me, the stars are alignin'<br>
But for her, it's bad timin'<br>
So she just can't be mine<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
All they wanna do is break<br>
my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
They just wanna see me<br>
fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)<br>
So I hook up on a rebound<br>
And I say that I'm gonna be<br>
single for life<br>
But she's so pretty<br>
and nice (Pretty and nice)<br>
So I made just one exception<br>
But I find out eventually<br>
I'm not her type<br>
Baby, that's the reason why, that<br>
For me, the stars are alignin'<br>
But for her, it's bad timin'<br>
So she just can't be mine<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore (Yeah)<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
All they wanna do is break<br>
my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore (No)<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
They just wanna see me<br>
fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)<br>
I'm trying not to be bitter<br>
But damn it, I miss her<br>
'Cause she's one of a kind<br>
For me, the stars are alignin'<br>
But for her, it's bad timin'<br>
So she just can't be mine<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
All they wanna do is break<br>
my heart, my heart (Oh-oh)<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
They just wanna see me<br>
fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)<br>
Then we fall,<br>
we fall, fall, fall apart now<br>
I don't think<br>
that I like her anymore<br>
Cause they're all the same<br>
They just wanna see me<br>
fall apart, apart (Oh-oh)<br>
