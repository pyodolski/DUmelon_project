        Money makes me feel better<br>
        You told me it was a ticket to hell,<br>
        ok how come?<br>
        Do you think that I’m a devil?<br>
        Sex makes me feel better,<br>
        how could you judge me?<br>
        I know you don't deserve to<br>
        Now You act like a Pharisee<br>
        When I was poor,<br>
        my mom was stressed out<br>
        Now look, money made me<br>
        a good boy to my mom<br>
        When I was poor,<br>
        I was like a hungry fox<br>
        Now look, I saved a lotta<br>
        buddies from the basement<br>
        I just bought a Christian,<br>
        it’s blinging on my body<br>
        I’m toasting with celebrities
        at the same bar<br>
        Hey pretty,<br>
        do you wanna f*** with me?<br>
        That’s no problem<br>
        But Sunday morning is coming,<br>
        I gotta go to church<br>
        I’m still f***ing christian<br>
        Though I’m wearing new “Christian”<br>
        You should check my algorithm<br>
        It’s not much different<br>
        from the old me<br>

        I’m still f***ing<br>
        Stinky smell’s stuck in my room<br>
        Even after I took a shower<br>
        How can I erase it<br>
        Where’s the origin ?<br>
        Hey Mr. I’m talking about you<br>
        What’s funny? Seriously?<br>
        You feel this disgusting smell<br>
        I think it’s from your stinky breath<br>
        Street people, you think you’re smart<br>
        You think you got no god<br>
        But I know you worship yourself<br>
        What a stupid god !<br>
        Is your god a liar?<br>
        Your god is so outrageous,<br>
        you would better die<br>
