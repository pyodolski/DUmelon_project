    <p>
        This is gonna hurt<br>
but I blame myself first<br>
cause I ignored the truth<br>
Drunk off that love my head up<br>
there's no forgetting you<br>
You've awoken me<br>
but you're choking me<br>
I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me<br>
and now honestly<br>
I've got nothing left<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the<br>
speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion<br>
ruined me<br>
Baby I loved you dangerously<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
Usually I hold the power with<br>
both my hands tied behind my back<br>
Look at how things change<br>
cause now you're the train<br>
and I'm tied to the track<br>
You've awoken me<br>
but you're choking me<br>
I was so obsessed<br>
Gave you all of me and now<br>
honestly I've got nothing left<br>
Cause I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Knew we would crash at the<br>
speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion<br>
ruined me<br>
Baby I loved you dangerously<br>
You took me down<br>
down down down<br>
And kissed my lips with goodbye<br>
I see you now now now now<br>
It was a matter of time<br>
You know I know<br>
there's only one place<br>
this could lead<br>
But you are the fire<br>
I'm gasoline<br>
I love you I love you I love you<br>
I loved you dangerously<br>
More than the air that I breathe<br>
Oh now I knew we would crash at<br>
the speed that we were going<br>
Didn't care if the explosion<br>
ruined me<br>
Oh oh baby I loved you<br>
dangerously<br>
Oo I loved you dangerously<br>
Oo oo I loved you dangerously<br>
    </p>
